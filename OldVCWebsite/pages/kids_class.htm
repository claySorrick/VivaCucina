Kids have a great time in these private GROUP hands-on cooking classes for ages 12 years old and older. They learn how to prepare a recipe with the help of the culinary instructors. The classes take about two and a half hours, depending on the menu selected and the number of guests. The cost is $54.00 per person and includes recipes, instruction, ingredients, kitchen set- up, clean-up and aprons to wear while cooking. These classes hold minimum 6 to 15 maximum students at a time. They all prepare the recipes and then sit down to eat their creations.
