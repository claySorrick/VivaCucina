<strong><font size="+2">The Chef's Table - A Private Dinner with the Chef</font></strong>
<br /><br />
<strong>The Chef’s Table at Viva Cucina</strong> is a new series of private dinners with San Ramon Valley’s premier local restaurant chefs, where customers watch while we prepare a four course meal, then sit down with us and enjoy the meal, wine and conversation together. Join us for our private chef dinners this year. Seating is limited, so make your reservations early.

We will be offering these classes again in the spring with a variety of chefs. The classes are usually on a Sunday from 6:00 to 9:00pm at Viva Cucina. The cost of these classes varies by menu, and reservations are required. We usually have a winery join us for a private tasting with the meal.

This is a great opportunity for customers to learn from and eat dinner with these local chefs and wineries, in an informal private atmosphere. The winemakers will pour their specialty wines for us to taste, as well as pair the wines for the evening’s meal. We will also provide soft drinks and appetizers for these classes.

Chefs are able to come together with their customers, in a private dinner setting, sharing with their customers how they prepare their dishes and the various techniques they use to create their food, while cooking in front of their customers. We reserve the right to change ingredients as needed.
