Unlike other cooking classes where the students just watch, take notes, cut a few herbs and stir a few liquids in a pot, Barbara’s classes are actual hands-on cooking classes. Students prepare the recipes from start to finish, talk about the process, so you can reproduce the recipes at home with ease.

Her classes are great for people who enjoy cooking and want to learn how to <strong>“cook outside the box”</strong>, as well as for the beginner cooks who want to feel at ease cooking and entertaining. Keeping things simple and planning is the key to successful entertaining!
