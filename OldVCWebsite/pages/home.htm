Viva Cucina - the bay area’s Hands-on Cooking Classes, located in the Tri-vally, San Ramon. Where you <strong>“learn to cook with ease”</strong> with culinary instructor, Barbara Kelly, in a <strong>One-on-One Class</strong> or <strong>Private Group Class</strong> or join us for one of our <strong>Boutique Winemaker Dinner Events</strong>.<br />
<br />
Barbara teaches her students the cooking process and takes the guess work out of each recipe, giving you the confidence and experience to be a better cook. In these hands-on cooking classes you get involved in preparing each step of the recipe and enjoy eating the results without having to do the dishes. 
<br/><br />
You will receive recipes, cooking tips and be able to ask detailed cooking questions while preparing your recipe. Viva Cucina takes care of the details; recipes, ingredients, shopping, instruction, kitchen setup and clean up.
